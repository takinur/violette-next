      The Eccotemp 20H Outdoor Natural Gas Tankless Water Heater is one of the
      largest outdoor models of the Eccotemp tankless line. Rated at an
      impressive 6.0 gallons per minute (GPM) and 150,000 BTU per hour, the
      Eccotemp 20H-NG can meet all the hot-water needs of a standard home or
      apartment with one or two bathrooms, as well as smaller commercial
      applications. The compact, wall mounted Eccotemp 20H-NG is powered by
      natural gas. The Eccotemp 20H-NG is ready to install with its 110/120-volt

        heater quarterly can result in lime and sediment build up within the
        heater, which can void your warranty! We recommend using our Eccotemp

        lasting heater!
